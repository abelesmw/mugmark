Mugmark Video game

This repository contains the code for my video game Mugmark. It's an homage to Cuphead (pretty obviously, if you check it out). Here is a link to a demo level: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDwu2OX3R_0

Some notes about the project:

*  I hand-drew all of the frames of animation using Procreate on iPad.
*  I built the game in Unity
*  I wrote all of the code in Visual Studio in C#
