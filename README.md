Mugmark Video game

This repository contains the code for my video game Mugmark. It's an homage to Cuphead (pretty obviously, if you check it out). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDwu2OX3R_0" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to a demo level.

Some notes about the project:

*  All of the frames of animation and hand drawn using Procreate on iPad.
*  Game is built in Unity
*  All of the code was written in Visual Studio in C#
